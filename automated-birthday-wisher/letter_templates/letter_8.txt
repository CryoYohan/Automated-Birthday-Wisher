Dear [NAME],

May the light of the stars shine brightly upon your brow this day. 
The road goes ever on, yet may your path lead always to green pastures and warm hearths. 
May your years be as enduring as the roots of the mountains, and your tale be sung with 
joy in the halls of the wise.

Sincerely,
Cyril the Grey Wizard
